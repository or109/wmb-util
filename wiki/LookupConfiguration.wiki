#labels Phase-Implementation
The default option is to use the JdbcLookupDateSource with its default configuration. The default configuration is stored in a properties file in the WMB work path, typically  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\MQSI on Windows. The file must be named lookup-connection.properties.

It must contain the following properties:

 * lookup.class: the JDBC driver class name
 * lookup.url: the JDBC URL for the database
 * lookup.username: the user name used for logging into the database
 * lookup.password:  the password used for logging into the database

For example:
{{{
lookup.class=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
lookup.url=jdbc:db2://172.0.0.1:50000/WBRKDATA
lookup.username=sa
lookup.password=sa
}}}

Just must also make sure that your JDBC driver JARs are available for WMB. The driver for DB2 ships with WMB. In addition, you also need commons-pool-1.3.jar and commons-dbcp-1.2.2.jar in shared-classes.

As a security measure, make sure that the file is only accessible for the broker user.

After getting everything in place you have to restart WMB.
